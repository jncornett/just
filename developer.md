=================

Subcommands
-----------
- Whenever possible, use names that make unambiguous sense.

Architecture
------------
- All states that a user can reach by using the CLI should be bidirectional

Output
------
- Pretty mode should look good on a terminal with 80 columns and 20 rows and 16 colors
